Boss Rush game created with Javascript, HTML, and CSS

Fight through several areas and try to get to the end within the time limit.
Each area has 3 enemies and 1 boss to defeat. The player can use their sword to
attack, cast fireball, cast heal, or defend. The game ends when time runs out, 
the player dies, or the final boss dies.

*I do NOT own any of the assets used with this project. This included images,
soundeffects, music, and animations.

To play open the main.html file.
